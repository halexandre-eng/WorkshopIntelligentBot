# Workshop Intelligent Bot

In this hands on workshop, you’ll create a simple financial Bot, configure its artifacts, test it and deploy it to a sample web application.

You will create intents (you can think of an intent as the meaning behind what the user wants to do), add utterances (sample phrases to help your bot reference intents when it parses the user input), add entities (extra content to enable your bot to complete a user request), configure system components (built-in components that allow you to perform typical interactions with the users, control the flow, perform language detection and manipulate variables) and custom components (REST services that allow the Bot to interface with external APIs) and finally configure messaging channels where you enable a messaging platform to use your bot.

The Oracle Intelligent Bots platform has many other capabilities but we won’t be able to
explore all of them during this lab.
